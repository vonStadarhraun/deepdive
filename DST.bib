  abstract  = {Long-term population viability of Bay of Fundy Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is threatened by high levels of marine mortality during migration. Pop-up satellite archival tags on repeat spawners provide direct evidence of extensive natural mortality of migrating salmon in coastal zones attributed to predation by large pelagic fish and no evidence of fishing mortality. Ingested tags show that salmon with a coastal migration are eaten by porbeagle shark (Lamna nasus) inside the Bay of Fundy, whereas distant migrants are consumed by Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) and other apex predators along the Scotian Shelf. Mortality is clustered in a few zones because of similar predator–prey habitat preferences and overlapping migration paths. The extent of predation in salmon populations with different migration strategies can account for observed decline rates in neighbouring populations with different life histories.

  abstract = {Migrations between different habitats are key events in the lives of many organisms. Such movements involve annually recurring travel over long distances usually triggered by seasonal changes in the environment. Often, the migration is associated with travel to or from reproduction areas to regions of growth. Young anadromous Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) emigrate from freshwater nursery areas during spring and early summer to feed and grow in the North Atlantic Ocean. The transition from the freshwater ('parr') stage to the migratory stage where they descend streams and enter salt water ('smolt') is characterized by morphological, physiological and behavioural changes where the timing of this parr-smolt transition is cued by photoperiod and water temperature. Environmental conditions in the freshwater habitat control the downstream migration and contribute to within- and among-river variation in migratory timing. Moreover, the timing of the freshwater emigration has likely evolved to meet environmental conditions in the ocean as these affect growth and survival of the post-smolts. Using generalized additive mixed-effects modelling, we analysed spatio-temporal variations in the dates of downstream smolt migration in 67 rivers throughout the North Atlantic during the last five decades and found that migrations were earlier in populations in the east than the west. After accounting for this spatial effect, the initiation of the downstream migration among rivers was positively associated with freshwater temperatures, up to about 10 °C and levelling off at higher values, and with sea-surface temperatures. Earlier migration occurred when river discharge levels were low but increasing. On average, the initiation of the smolt seaward migration has occurred 2.5 days earlier per decade throughout the basin of the North Atlantic. This shift in phenology matches changes in air, river, and ocean temperatures, suggesting that Atlantic salmon emigration is responding to the current global climate changes.},

abstract = {Over 10 million salmon smolts were produced in Iceland in 1989. That is ten-fold the production 5 years ago. Thereof, about 6 million smolts were used in ocean ranching and about 2 million smolts went to cage-rearing operation. The rest is reared in land-based tanks.The number of reared fish entering salmon rivers has increased as the salmon culture growed, especially in S.W. Iceland where large part of the salmon-culture is operated.To evaluate the proportion of reared fish in salmon rivers, scale samples have been taken from salmon catches in rivers of Iceland. The scales have been used to identify escapes from cage farms and straying fish from ocean-ranching stations. From such analysis it is observed that the proportion of reared fish is low in North Iceland but is high in S.W. Iceland and is increasing from year to year, being up to 70{\%} of the catch in one river.In River Ellidaar, a famous salmon river in Reykjavik the proportion of reared salmon in the catch in 1989 was 30.1{\%}, compared to 15.9{\%} in 1988. The reared fish were distributed evenly up the river in 1988, but in 1989 a higher proportion of the reared fish was caught downstream.Salmon escapees generally ascend the rivers later than the natural salmon. Almost all the reared fish examined in the rivers were sexually mature. Reared fish have been caught as kelts in the spring in River Ellidaar.},

Additionally the return rate and growth of individuals tagged with PSATs was compared with those of small acoustic tags and DSTs. Overall, the depth distribution of individuals tagged with PSATs was similar to that of those tagged with DSTs, reflecting the pelagic nature of S. salar at sea. Individuals tagged with PSATs, however, dived less frequently and to shallower depths, and dived and surfaced at slower velocities. Sea surface temperatures experienced by individuals tagged with PSATs were similar to those experienced by those tagged with DSTs for the same time of year, suggesting that there were no large differences in the ocean migration. Return rates did not depend on whether individuals were tagged with PSATs or not, indicating that survival at sea was not impacted by PSATs in comparison to small internal tags. Individuals tagged with PSATs, however, had a smaller increase in body mass than those tagged with acoustic tags or DSTs. It was concluded that PSATs are suitable for use in researching large-scale migratory behaviour of adult S. salar at sea, but that some effects on their behaviour from tagging must be expected. Effects of PSATs may be largest in the short term when S. salar are swimming in bursts at high speeds. Even though individuals tagged with PSATs performed deep and frequent dives, the results of this study suggest that untagged individuals would perform even deeper and more frequent dives than tagged individuals.},

Catches of grilse in rivers were strongly correlated among the 22 rivers, as were the ratios of grilse caught to two-sea winter (2SW) salmon caught the next year. Four of the 22 rivers showed increasing ratios over time and three of these rivers, all in the northeast, had significantly higher mean ratios after the expansion of the Faroese fishery than before (P {\textless} 0.05). No evidence was found from ratios for the other 18 rivers to suggest that Faroese fishing was significantly depleting those stocks, even though 13 micro-tagged north-coast salmon had been recovered in the fishery in the 1988–1989 season. No evidence was found that Norwegian Sea or West Greenland fisheries affected stock composition. The mean April–May sea temperature prior to when the smolts enter the sea was significantly and positively related to ratios in eight of the 22 rivers. This result, along with frequent significant correlations in ratios among rivers, indicated that more rapid growth of smolts in their first summer may have increased grilse to 2SW salmon ratios on several rivers.},

All sea trout were recaptured after they spent 1–40 days at sea, while all Arctic charr were recaptured after 0.5–33 days at sea. On average, trout preferred water about 0.6 m deeper and 1.3°C warmer than Arctic charr. Arctic charr spent {\textgreater}50{\%} of their time between 0 and 1 m depth, while trout spent {\textgreater}50{\%} of their time between 1 and 2 m depth. Both species spent {\textgreater}90{\%} of their time in water no deeper than 3 m from the water surface. However, sea trout dove more frequently and to greater depths (max. 28 m) than Arctic charr (max. 16 m), and these deep dives were most frequently performed at the end of the sea migration. Arctic charr demonstrated a diel diving pattern, staying on average about 0.5 m deeper between 08:00 hours and about 15:00 hours than during the rest of the 24 h, even though there was continuous daylight during the experiments. When comparing data obtained from the DSTs with temperature measurements within the fjord system, the two species were observed to select different feeding areas during their sea migration, the sea trout choosing the inner and warmer parts of the fjord, in contrast to the Arctic charr that preferred the outer, colder parts of the fjord. The observed differences in migration behaviour between the two species are discussed in relation to species preferences for prey and habitat selection, and their optimal temperatures for growth.},

The most important fisheriesindependent dataset used for tuning the analytical stock assessment comes from the Norwegian surveys of blue whiting west off the British Isles. The survey is carried out in March/April during peak spawning, and improving its quality will have a direct positive effect on stock assessment. Here, we analyse diel effects on the abundance and vertical distribution as recorded by acoustics in 1995 and 1996 and from 1998 to 2002, and evaluate the potential effects on the survey estimates. On average, the acoustic density of blue whiting was 20{\%} higher by day than by night. However, the diel bias varied considerably among years, and surprisingly, the acoustic density in shallow water (,350 m) was in general highest at night, when the blue whiting were distributed higher in the water column and more dispersed. The span in the vertical depth range increased considerably with bottom depth in water shallower than 550 m. In deeper water, where blue whiting had little or no bottom association, the day–night differences in vertical distribution were smaller and not affected by bottom depth. The inconsistency of the diel effect from year to year negatively affects the time-series used during annual stock assessments.},

In May-June 2013, pop-up satellite tags programmed to detach from fish after 1-10 d were fitted to 50 adult salmon on the northern coast of Scotland. Most of the tags returned water depth recorded at regular intervals (n = 47) and gave a geographic location following detachment (n = 44). In general, salmon were found near the surface during the study, with the median number of records at 0-5 m depth ranging from 72 to 85{\%}, depending on the extent of known potential systematic bias. Depth use varied among individuals (8-100{\%} at 0-5 m) and cluster analysis suggested that the sample of fish could be split into two groups, representing different patterns of depth use. These clusters were also associated with pop-up location. There was a small but significant increase in recorded depth at night compared with during the day, contrasting with findings of salmon at sea in other contexts. The mean maximum dive depth was 64 m (range 13-118 m), of similar order to the likely available water column depth. These results suggest that salmon will potentially interact with man-made obstacles, e.g. renewable energy generators, throughout the water column and particularly in surface waters.},

The post-smolts fed largely on 0-group fish. Blue whiting was an important prey only in the slope current transporting the larvae from the spawning areas west of the United Kingdom into the North and Norwegian Seas. Sandeel and herring were important or present in the stomachs throughout most of the area studied. Unusually large quantities of 0-group herring in the Norwegian Sea in summer 2002 coincided with a high condition factor of post-smolts that year. The forage ratio of the post-smolts was positively related to the proportion of herring in the stomachs and the abundance of herring recruits. Despite these findings, the most productive period for Atlantic salmon on record, the 1970s, coincided with the collapse of the Norwegian spring-spawning herring, which raises the question as to whether herring is more important as a competitor than as a food source. Hyperiid amphipods were more important prey than krill, in contrast to the situation for other pelagic fish species.},

The recruitment of Atlantic salmon in Europe. ICES Journal of Marine Science, 66: 289-304.The stock complex of Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, in Europe has experienced a multidecadal decline in recruitment, resulting in the lowest stock abundances observed since 1970. Here, physical forcing, biological interactions, and the resultant growth response of post-smolt salmon are examined with a view to understanding the mechanism controlling recruitment. Sea surface temperature (SST) has increased in the Northeast Atlantic, with the pattern and seasonal change in SST negatively correlated with post-smolt survival during summer and in a region that spatially matches the post-smolt nursery. Constituents of the pelagic foodweb, including potential post-smolt food and plankton that may affect post-smolt forage, have changed on a decadal scale and correlate with salmon survival. Retrospective growth analyses of eight stock/sea age components show that post-smolt growth during summer is positively correlated with salmon survival and recruitment. The Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation appears to be a more closely aligned climate forcing index than the North Atlantic Oscillation with respect to salmon recruitment. European Atlantic salmon recruitment appears to be governed by factors that affect the growth of post-smolts during their first summer at sea, including SST and forage abundances; growth appears to mediate survival by the functional relationship between post-smolts and their predators.},

  abstract = {Thermal habitat was recorded by data storage tags (DSTs) applied to Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) kelts during their seaward migration in the spring of 1998 at enumeration facilities in Highlands River, Humber River, Western Arm Brook, and Campbellton River, Newfoundland. In total, 139 DSTs were applied and data were downloaded from eleven of the recovered tags. The recovered tags had been applied at Highlands, Campbellton and Western Arm rivers and recovered in the coastal waters of Newfoundland and Quebec and at the enumeration facilities at Highlands and Campbellton rivers. Water temperatures experienced by the fish were recorded for periods of 62-118 days at resolutions of 15-30 min. The data from the sea record on the DSTs were analysed for temperature patterns in relation to migration behaviour and diurnal movement of the fish. A variety of patterns were exhibited on the temperature records suggesting that the fish were behaving in various ways at different times. For Campbellton and Highlands fish over the course of some 24 h periods, night-time temperatures changed little and were among the highest daily temperatures experienced by the fish, whereas daytime temperatures often showed dramatic and frequent shifts in temperature presumably as the fish rapidly and frequently changed depth. For the Western Arm Brook fish, rapid fluctuations in temperature occurred sometimes during the day and night without a consistent diurnal pattern. We also considered large-scale aspects of the data by examining oceanographic conditions in relation to the temperatures recorded by the tags.},

We caught the wild smolts in a smolt trap and selected the largest individuals from the run. We implanted the transmitters in the abdominal cavity of the fish and then released them in River Ellidaar close to the estuary. We used four ultrasonic receivers; one in the river's estuary, one outside the estuary and two further away on both sides of an island in the estuary zone. The receivers recorded all transmitters within a 600 m radius. The hatchery smolts were larger than the wild smolts. Some of the smolts were lost on the way through the estuary. Only 4 out of 9 wild smolts and 14 of 17 hatchery smolts were recorded all the way through. The tags and the tagging likely affected the survival of the smolts especially the smaller fish. There were no differences in the smolt migration between the 2 years of study and no differences in the migration behavior between the wild and the hatchery smolts. After being released the smolts stayed on average for 10 h in the river then migrated into the estuary were they stayed for 54 h on average. Then they migrated straight through the area to the sea at approximately 0.2 fish lengths per second. We recorded large differences in the migration.},

abstract = {Despite slow nutrient supply to the subtropical surface ocean, the rates of annual inorganic carbon uptake and net oxygen production are similar to those of nutrient-rich high-latitude waters. This surprisingly high subtropical carbon uptake cannot be fully accounted for by sediment trap-collected sinking particles and the downward mixing of suspended and dissolved organic carbon. We propose an explanation for these paradoxical observations: gel-like organic matter rich in carbon but poor in nutrients, akin to transparent exopolymer particles, is produced by phytoplankton under nutrient limitation, and a portion sinks into the shallow subsurface, where it is respired by heterotrophic bacteria. This organic matter would evade detection by sediment traps, effectively representing an additional (sinking-driven) source of dissolved organic carbon to the subsurface. Building on existing evidence for the production of such nutrient-poor organic matter in surface waters, we describe evidence for its decomposition in the shallow subsurface of the Sargasso Sea. First, oxygen at these depths is consumed over the summer without comparable production of nitrate. Second, a seasonal change in the},

abstract = {Ecologists have an unprecedented array of bio-logging technologies available to conduct in situ studies of horizontal and vertical movement patterns of marine animals. These tracking data provide key information about foraging, migratory, and other behaviours that can be linked with bio-physical datasets to understand physiological and ecological influences on habitat selection. In most cases, however, the behavioural context is not directly observable and therefore, must be inferred. Animal movement data are complex in structure, entailing a need for stochastic analysis methods. The recent development of state-space modelling approaches for animal movement data provides statistical rigor for inferring hidden behavioural states, relating these states to bio-physical data, and ultimately for predicting the potential impacts of climate change. Despite the widespread utility, and current popularity, of state-space models for analysis of animal tracking data, these tools are not simple and require considerable care in their use. Here we develop a methodological “road map” for ecologists by reviewing currently available state-space implementations. We discuss appropriate use of state-space methods for location and/or behavioural state estimation from different tracking data types. Finally, we outline key areas where the methodology is advancing, and where it needs further development.},

  abstract  = {This paperback edition is a reprint of the 2000 edition. This book provides an overview of the theory and application of linear and nonlinear mixed-effects models in the analysis of grouped data, such as longitudinal data, repeated measures, and multilevel data. A unified model-building strategy for both linear and nonlinear models is presented and applied to the analysis of over 20 real datasets from a wide variety of areas, including pharmacokinetics, agriculture, and manufacturing. A strong emphasis is placed on the use of graphical displays at the various phases of the model-building process, starting with exploratory plots of the data and concluding with diagnostic plots to assess the adequacy of a fitted model. Over 170 figures areincluded in the book. The NLME package for analyzing mixed-effects models in R and S-PLUS, developed by the authors, provides the underlying software for implementing the methods presented in the text, being described and illustrated in detail throughout the book. The balanced mix of real data examples, modeling software, and theory makes this book a useful reference for practitioners using mixed-effects models in their data analyses. It can also be used as a text for a one-semester graduate-level applied course in mixed-effects models. Researchers in statistical computing will also find this book appealing for its presentation of novel and efficient computational methods for fitting linear and nonlinear mixed-effects models. Jos{\'{e}} C. Pinheiro is a Senior Biometrical Fellow at Novartis Pharmaceuticals, having worked at Bell Labs during the time this book was produced. He has published extensively in mixed-effects models, dose finding methods in clinical development, and other areas of biostatistics. Douglas M. Bates is Professor of Statistics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He is the author, with Donald G. Watts, of Nonlinear Regression Analysis and Its Applications, a Fellow of the American Statistical Association, and a former chair of the Statistical Computing Section.},

A new depth-sensitive transmitter was used and is described. A behavior common to all individuals were occasional rapid excursions down to the main thermocline, or, if the initial swimming depth was in the stratification, upwards to the mixed layer. The amplitude of the dives was 5-15 m, and seemed related to the distance to the thermocline. The vertical velocities of the dives was 0.1 m/s. The detailed vertical temperature distribution along the trajectory was recorded. A comparison of the temperature field and the swimming depth indicated that the salmon tended to follow fine structure gradient layers in the quasi-mixed surface layer or in the thermocline. These observations are interpreted using a model of olfactive orientation, where the salmon uses information found in the vertical to choose horizontal direction. The dives are seen as exploratory searches of the vertical distribution of a home stream odor. By choosing the fine structure gradient layer with the maximum concentration difference and then orientating against the direction of the local shear, the salmon has a strategy which would lead towards the origin of the olfactant. Measurements which indicate a slightly elevated body temperature in salmon, and some faculty of thermoregulation, are discussed.},

Brood stocks were collected in eight Norwegian rivers situated between 59 and 69 degrees N. The fish were reared to smolts, individually tagged and released in the River Imsa, south-west Norway (59 degrees N). Adults from all stocks approached the Norwegian coast concurrently, but Atlantic salmon {\textgreater}= 70 cm in natural tip length entered coastal water slightly earlier during summer than smaller fish. Atlantic salmon {\textless} 70 cm, however, ascended the river significantly earlier and at lower water flow and higher water temperature than larger fish. Although largest in size, the fish from the northern populations (62-69 degrees N) ascended the River Imsa almost 1 month earlier than those from the south (59-60 degrees N). They seemed less restricted by the environmental factors than the fish originating from the more southern rivers. There was no apparent trend among years in time of river ascent. Maximum ascent per day occurred at water discharges between 12.5 and 15 m(3) s(-1) and at water temperatures between 10 and 12.5 degrees C. There was a significant positive correlation between water flow and river ascent during the first part of the upstream run from July to September with best correlation for September, when multiple regression analysis indicated that water temperature had an additional positive effect. Stock origin, fish size and water discharge were important variables influencing the upstream migration of Atlantic salmon in small rivers. (c) 2007 The Authors.},

Mean swimming depth was shallow (2.5–0.5 m), but with dives down to 30 m depth. Timing of river entry was not affected by river flow, diel periodicity, or tidal cycles. Movements during the last part of the marine migration and river entry were unidirectional and relatively fast (mean 9.7 km{\textperiodcentered}day−1).

  abstract = {Data storage tags (DSTs) were applied to Atlantic salmon (Salmo solar L.) smolts during their seaward migration in the spring of 2002 at a fish counting fence on Campbellton River, Newfoundland. Our objectives were to discover whether or not salmon smolts could carry DSTs and survive, whether or not useful data on thermal habitat could be obtained and interpreted, and whether or not salmon smolts moved vertically in the water column. Data were downloaded from 15 of the recovered tags and revealed the hourly water temperatures experienced by the fish for periods of 3 to 71 days. The data on the DSTs were analyzed for temperature patterns in relation to migration behavior and diurnal movement of the fish. While in the sea, the DSTs recorded night temperatures of 12.5 degrees C, which were higher than day temperatures of 11.6 degrees C; the record from moored recorders, however, indicated that sea temperatures actually declined at night. It is hypothesized that postsmolts avoid avian predators during daylight hours by positioning themselves deeper in the water column and that they were pursuing prey during the deeper vertical descents or ascents noted during the periods of more rapid changes in temperature.},

abstract = {An 18-year record of stable isotopes from Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) migrating to two different regions of the North Atlantic reveals climate-driven subdecadal variations. Time-series of carbon isotopes in one salmon stock, thought to feed in the Faroes/Iceland Basin area, show Subpolar Gyre (SPG) modal variability, which is not seen in fish feeding in the Norwegian Sea. At times of weak SPG circulation, when waters in the Iceland Basin are relatively warm, carbon isotope values are somewhat negative, suggesting possible changes in phytoplankton community structure. The fluctuations in plankton community dynamics suggested by the stable isotope values are coincident with fluctuations in the estimates of marine mortality in one sea-winter fish feeding in the Norwegian Sea, but not in those feeding in the Iceland Basin. Marine mortality in salmon feeding in the Iceland Basin is therefore likely to be more strongly influenced by factors other than bottom–up control. Time-series analysis of stable isotopes in consumer tissues provides information on the interaction between climate and ecosystem dynamics on the scale of individual stocks and cohorts.},

Hyperiid amphipods of the genus Themisto, euphausiids and mesope- lagic shrimps are important sources of food for salmon in the autumn period and various mesopelagic fish as lantern fishes, pearlsides and barracudinas become equally important during the late winter period. The occasional presence in the stomachs of larger fish such as herring, blue whiting and mackerel is not considered to be evidence that these fish are a main source of food for salmon in the sea north of the Faroes. The proportion of stomachs containing food was significantly lower during autumn (53{\%}) than during winter (78{\%}). However, temperature-dependent evacuation rates could partly explain the apparent lower stomach content during the autumn, since the average ambient sea-surface temperature is 7?C in autumn compared to 3?C in winter. There was evidence of selective foraging. Fish were preferred over crustaceans, and amphipods were chosen over euphausiids. Large salmon (3+SW) tended to be more piscivorous than smaller fish. There was no difference in condition factor, number and weight proportions of prey, or in diet between wild and escaped farmed salmon, which suggests that escaped farmed salmon adapt well to the ‘‘wild'' life in the ocean.},

abstract = {The Atlantic salmon Salmo salar L. is native to the temperate and subarctic regions of the North Atlantic Ocean. The species has a complex and diverse array of life-histories, but most forms are anadromous with a juvenile phase in fresh water, followed by smoltification and a long migration to the ocean for feeding and growth, and a return migration to fresh water to spawn. Atlantic salmon return with a high precision to their home river, and typi- cally only a small percentage of a population strays to other rivers. Precise homing may generate and maintain local adaptations through natural selection, and salmon populations in different rivers differ both ecologically and genetically. Individuals of some populations complete their entire life cycle in fresh water, while others may undertake only short migra- tions to brackish water in estuaries, or stay within marine areas close to the home river. Factors affecting spawning and feeding migrations may impact the reproductive success and survival of individual fish. Migration studies identify pathways, and critical habitats like feeding and spawning areas, and hence are essential for the protection of Atlantic salmon populations. In this chapter, we synthesise information on patterns and mechanisms of movement during Atlantic salmon migrations, covering the freshwater, estuary and marine phases. An overview of the Atlantic salmon life cycle and geographical distribution is also given.},

The analyses have a spatial grid resolution of 0.25° and a temporal resolution of 1 day. One product uses the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) infrared satellite SST data. The other uses AVHRR and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR) on the NASA Earth Observing System satellite SST data. Both products also use in situ data from ships and buoys and include a large-scale adjustment of satellite biases with respect to the in situ data. Because of AMSR's near-all-weather coverage, there is an increase in OI signal variance when AMSR is added to AVHRR. Thus, two products are needed to avoid an analysis variance jump when AMSR became available in June 2002. For both products, the results show improved spatial and temporal resolution compared to previous weekly 1° OI analyses.

abstract = {Knowledge of the migrations and geographic distribution of post-smelts of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) in oceanic waters is sparse. Surface trawl surveys were carried out by the Institute of Marine Research, Bergen, Norway, in the Norwegian Sea and adjacent areas in 1990-1998. Sampling was carired out south of 62 degreesN in May-June, in the Norwegian Sea north of 62 degreesN in July-August and in the Barents Sea in August-September. In a total of 955 surface trawl hauls, 535 post-smelts were caught. The highest incidences of post-smelts were in the slope current west of the British Isles, where the highest catch per unit of effort (c.p.u.e.) value was recorded between northern Scotland and the Faroes in June 1997. The lowest c.p.u.e. was observed in August/September 1998 in the Barents Sea, where no post-smolts were caught. The post-smelts appear to follow the main surface currents northwards into the Norwegian Sea where they spread in a fan-like distribution over an area covering most of the international waters between the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of Norway, the Faroes and Iceland up to about 73-75 degreesN. This pattern appeared to be stable between these years with the exception of 1997, when almost no post-smelts were caught in the northernmost areas, although catches in the south were similar to or higher than in the previous years. The geographical distribution of post-smelts of Atlantic salmon is associated with the warmer, saline Atlantic water. (C) 2000 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate effects of the ban on the Norwegian coastal drift net fishery in 1989 on the spawning run of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) populations in four Norwegian and four Russian rivers. Catches/escapements, size distribution, sea-age proportions, and mean weights of different sea-age groups were collected from official catch statistics and analyses of scale samples. In three of the Norwegian rivers, catches of grilse (1SW) increased significantly after the ban on the drift net fishery. No changes were recorded for multi-sea-winter (MSW) fish. In addition, the proportion of grilse increased in all the Norwegian rivers, and 2SW salmon increased in three of them. The mean weight of grilse increased in all four Norwegian rivers, whereas the mean weight of 2SW fish decreased in the two rivers in southern Norway. The size of 3SW fish did not change. These changes correspond well to actual net selection curves and reported mean weight of drift net catches in different parts of Norway. Trends in the Russian populations were more varying. In the three rivers draining to the Barents Sea, changes were similar to those in the Norwegian rivers. However, these changes were less obvious than those observed in Norwegian populations. The authors conclude that the ban of the drift net fishery significantly affected the structure of the spawning run in Norwegian Atlantic salmon populations. Furthermore, the results indicate that the drift net fishery affected Russian salmon populations in rivers draining to the Barents Sea to a lesser extent than Norwegian salmon, and had no effect in rivers draining to the White Sea.},

abstract = {A method of dating the marine growth circuli on Atlantic salmon ( Salmo salar L.) scales is presented. Data were available for 54 salmon, intercepted as smolts at the completion of their downstream migration in the River North Esk, Scotland. Smolts were tagged, released, and recaptured as return adults after either one (1SW) or two (2SW) winters at sea. Dating of circuli was achieved by fitting a simple quadratic model to the circuli pertaining to fixed points on the scale. For 1SW fish, the latter were the dates of river emigration and completion of marine migration, and the midpoint circulus (equal to the winter solstice) of the winter annulus. For 2SW salmon, these were the date of emigration and the two winter annulus midpoints. A key assumption is that winter annulus formation arises from constraints of light availability on foraging, and hence, reduced growth rate. Comparative analyses indicate the method to be robust and effectively transferable to salmon of known capture date - but of unknown smolt emigration date - by assuming a fixed date of emigration; in such cases, circuli could still be allocated with confidence to a calendar month.

Here, we compare evidence from the North Sea and Gulf of Maine/Western Scotian Shelf (GoM/WSS) linking fluctuations in C finmarchicus abundance to changes in ocean circulation associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). A particularly striking contrast emerges from this Trans-Atlantic comparison: whereas the North Sea C finmarchicus population exhibits a negative correlation with the NAO index, the GoM/WSS population exhibits a more complex, positive association with the index. The physical processes underlying these contrasting population responses are discussed in the context of regional- to basin-scale circulation changes associated with the NAO. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

A retrospective growth analysis was by measuring intercirculi spacing patterns of the first sea-year zone of scales for fish of known stock survivorship. Observed growth patterns suggest that winter may be critical to smolt survival of North American stocks. An exploratory analysis of sea-surface temperature trends for north-eastern and north-western portions of the Atlantic Ocean was used to characterize habitat area as defined by temperature minima and maxima. Thermally-defined habitat was then compared with Atlantic salmon production indices. Findings for North American stocks suggest that the distribution of winter habitat in the Labrador Sea and Denmark Strait was critical. For European stocks, the findings suggest reduced overall post-smolt habitat in recent years which may have resulted from cooling in the North Sea and warming along the southern extent of nursery habitat. Our research shows the potential impact of global-scale environmental factors on Atlantic salmon production and recruitment.},

The migration success of hatchery-reared (N = 96) and wild (N = 38) smolts out of the estuaries was high (range, 90–97{\%}), and the overall success of postsmolts moving out of Passamaquoddy Bay and into the several passages leading to the Bay of Fundy was reasonable (range, 71–88{\%}). Estuary transit times were usually rapid ({\textless}36 h), and almost all smolts entered the bay during an ebb tide. Migration routes through Passamaquoddy Bay were then closely related to the counterclockwise residual surface current in this bay.

The salmon stocks, the Figgjo in southern Norway and the North Esk in eastern Scotland, reside in relatively un-impacted rivers that continue to sustain healthy runs of salmon. The return rates for one seawinter fish (1SW), the predominant age at maturity for both stocks, were highly correlated. An analysis of sea surface tempera- ture distributions for periods of high versus low return rate showed that when low sea surface temperatures dominate the North Sea and southern coast of Norway during May, salmon survival has been poor. Conversely, when high sea surface temperatures extend northward along the Norwegian coast during May, survival has been good. Ocean conditions can be further related to the recruitment process through growth studies for the North Esk stock. Post-smolt growth increments for returning 1SW fish showed that enhanced growth was associated with years during which temperature conditions were favorable, which in turn resulted in higher survival rates. The implicit linkage between growth and survival suggests that growth-mediated predation is the dominant source of recruitment variability. Mechanisms by which ocean climate may affect post-smolt growth are discussed.},

abstract = {We have developed a multidecadal retrospective growth history for the principal sea-age groups of the Miramichi River population of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) that characterizes freshwater growth and marine growth partitioned on a number of different time scales. Based on precedent with European salmon, we tested whether postsmolt growth was positively correlated with recruitment, assuming that growth during the postsmolt year mediates predation mortality. We found no such correlation in the Miramichi postsmolt growth pattern and instead found evidence of a negative correlation between growth and recruitment established by the second month that the fish were at sea. This negative correlation was interpreted as a density-dependant response of the population to recruitment determined early in the marine phase. There was inconsistent evidence that smolt size, as represented by freshwater zone length of the scale, influenced the pattern of recruitment. Finally, we found systematic differences between one-s...},

abstract = {The vertical distribution of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) is of interest to biologists and the fishing industry. An understanding of the normal vertical distribution and movement of salmon facilitates better manage- ment of both directed and non-salmon fisheries and better evaluation of research data. Salmon vertical distribu- tion can vary spatially in relation to distance from shore, depth of the water column, and by ocean region, and temporally by life-history stage, season, time of day, and ocean conditions. In coastal waters, juvenile salmon were usually less than 15 m from the surface. In offshore waters, salmon were usually within the top 40 to 60 m, above the thermocline, but occasionally were found from 80 to 120 m. They usually were near the surface at night, and moved vertically during the day. Sockeye salmon displayed the shallowest vertical distribution, followed by pink, coho, chum, and Chinook salmon. There are limited data for winter, but vertical distributions may not change substantially from summer in offshore waters, while it may shift in some species in coastal and shelf areas. There is a need for more long-term data, throughout the marine residency of individual fish.},

However, efforts to study salmon in the marine environment during the last 20 years have yielded scientific information which, although still sparse, has thrown light on the marine distribution of the fish in the north-east Atlantic. Knowledge about the marine migrations and distribution in time and space of the salmon is of vital importance to our understanding of both the general ecology of the species and the possible external influences that may lead to changes in growth and survival. The paper summarizes our current knowledge on the spatial and temporal distribution of the post-smolt salmon in the north-east Atlantic. A special emphasis is placed on data gathered in Norwegian and English coastal tracking studies, Faeroese, Norwegian and Irish tagging experiments, and recent experiments with post-smolt trawling in coastal waters and the open ocean. The relationship between the marine environment and fish distribution is discussed.},

Since the early 1980s, the ICES Working Group on North Atlantic Salmon has collated and interpreted catch data, exchanged information on research initiatives, and provided advice to managers in support of conservation efforts for Atlantic salmon. During the past three decades, the annual production of anadromous Atlantic salmon from more than 2000 rivers draining into the North Atlantic has been less than 10 million adult-sized salmon. This represents a minor component, by number and biomass, of the pelagic ecosystem in the North Atlantic Ocean. Ideally, Atlantic salmon would be assessed and managed based on river-specific stock units, the scale that best corresponds to the spawner to recruitment dynamic. In reality, comparatively few river-specific assessments are available for either the Northwest or the Northeast Atlantic. The marine survival of Atlantic salmon is low and, based on return rates of smolts to adults from monitored rivers, has declined since the mid- to late 1980s. Abundance has declined more severely for the multi-sea-winter components, and especially in the southern areas of the species' range. Common patterns in abundance, inferred at the level of stock complex in the North Atlantic, suggest that broad-scale factors are affecting productivity and abundance and that they are acting throughout the salmon's time at sea.},

  abstract  = {For migratory fishes such as Atlantic salmon, temporal variation in the utilization of thermal and depth habitats in the marine environment is likely to occur at both broad and fine scales, reflecting both ecological and metabolic factors. To test this, we implanted 26 Atlantic salmon kelts (i.e., post-spawners) descending Campbellton River, Newfoundland, with data storage tags that recorded date/time, internal and external temperatures, pressure, and light. The salmon that returned to Campbellton River after an average of 62 days at sea were consecutive spawning kelt. Detailed data were recovered from eight of these fish and revealed distinct patterns in their utilization of thermal and depth habitats. Water temperatures experienced over the period at sea showed a wide range for all fish (from {\textless} 0 to nearly 20 degrees C); however, there were two clear frequency modes; one at 6-7 degrees C and the other at 11-12 degrees C. The cooler mode was indicative of daytime profiles and the warmer mode of night-time profiles. This corresponded with the depth profiles, which indicated that salmon dove more frequently below 5 m (mean SD = 23 0.9 dives per day) and spent less time (approximately 18{\%}) near the sea surface 1 m) during the day than during the night (4 0.4 dives per night; approximately 45{\%} time {\textless} 1 m). The diurnal pattern may be indicative of a reliance on vision for feeding at depth and the short duration of dives 10 min) may be a strategy that allows salmon a metabolic advantage (e.g., swimming capacity) over their prey living constantly at depth in cool waters.},

  abstract  = {Atlantic salmon were tracked using ultrasonic transmitters in the archipelago and estuary of the presumed home river during their spawning migration. Trackings (21) were made off the River Lule in the Bothnian Gulf, 7 off the River Klaralven in Lake Vanern Sweden. Tracking times ranged up to 40 h (mean 16 h) and the tracking distance was up to 60 km (mean 19 km). Approximately 60{\%} of the trackings which lasted for more than 5 h showed erratic movements, statistically not significantly different from random walk. For this group the net progress was slow (typically 10 km/day) and the resulting direction could be both towards and away from the river. All these erratic tracks were observed in the river estuary or in the inner-most archipelago. The behavior is similar to that seen during the riverine phase of the migration. A high incidence of retrograde movements in 1 branch of the Lule estuary seems to be caused by pollution. The lesser group with a significant degree of oriented movement showed a net progress of .apprx. 25 km/day. In 3 cases, when recaptures made the river affiliation known or probable, the migration direction was towards the home river. The remaining 5 trackings show a direction away from the presumed home river. The observed cruising speed was in the range 0.5-1.0 body length/s. This speed is close to what theoretically would give a minimum energy consumption per unit distance traveled. Possible orientation cues are discussed and an experiment which shows that a salmon was sensitive to the presence of a weak magnetic field is presented. On numerous occasions the salmon were observed to detect and avoid traps and set nets. Detection was at .apprx. 10 m distance and seemed to be non-visual. A strong cooperation between different traps was noted. This means that a small increase in the number of salmon traps in the archipelago can have a considerable effect on the proportion of the total run which is caught in the river.},
